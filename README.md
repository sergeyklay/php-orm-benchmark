# PHP ORM Benchmark [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark)

The benchmark to compare performance of PHP ORM solutions.

Initially this project used Docker to facilitate PHP ORM benchmarks. But after [repeated](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/pull/12) [comments](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/issues/7) we added support to benchmarksing on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark). So everyone [can see the results](https://travis-ci.org/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark) or run them again. Actually I've enabled the daily [cron job on Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/).

We have noticed, that running benchmarks on Travis CI is a convenient, but not a very precise way to measure the code execution speed. The main reason for that is that Travis was designed to run tests. It shares resources between all re running builds and it means, that Travis cares about build execution, but it _doesn't care about the performance_, so benchmark results may vary from run to run. We will manually check results before publishing them to make sure they are not seriously affected by random performance of Travis, but you also can run the benchmark yourself using Docker.

## ORMs to Benchmark

* CakePHP ORM 3.5.10
* Doctrine ORM 2.5.14
* Eloquent 5.5.28
* PHP ActiveRecord 1.2.0
* Phalcon 3.3.1
* Propel ORM 2.0.0-alpha7
* Yii ActiveRecord 2.0.13.1
* DMS 0.8.2
* Nextras ORM 3.0.0-rc2

## What we test

* Insert a record to the Database
* Get first record with relation
* Get first record with relation and metadata caching
* Insert a record to the Database (10-fold method call)
* Get first record with relation (10-fold method call)
* Get first record with relation and metadata caching (10-fold method call)
* Get a batch of first 20 records with relation
* Get a batch of first 20 records with relation and metadata caching
* Get a batch of first 200 records with relation
* Get a batch of first 200 records with relation and metadata caching

## Travis CI Benchmarking Environment

* Ubuntu 14.04.5 (Trusty) 64bit
* PHP 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
* Zend OPcache 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
* MySQL 5.6

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Linux, macOS or BDS System
* Docker CE/EE >= 17.09.0
* Docker Compose >= 1.17
* PHP >= 7.0
* Composer

### Build local image

First you have to build the benchmark application. Go to project root and run command as follows:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark.git
cd php-orm-benchmark
docker-compose build --force-rm --no-cache
```

We advise you to rely on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage projectsâ€™ dependencies. You have to download and install Composer itself in a common location or in project root by executing in a terminal the command like this:

```bash
wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
# If you haven't wget on your computer
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then, to install all project's dependencies, type the following from the project root:

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

Each ORM provider has its own dependencies. So you have to install them:

**NOTE:** If you have local composer.phar installed you'll need to replace `composer install` by `php ../../composer.phar install`

```bash
cd provider
for provider in `ls`; do echo $provider; cd $provider; composer install; cd ..; done
```

**NOTE:** You may skip Phalcon by running `php composer.phar install --ignore-platform-reqs`, if you don't have it installed at host system.

Finally, start the benchmark application:

```bash
docker-compose run benchmark
```

### Running Benchmark

To run benchmark simple run command as follows:

```bash
php run <provider> <test>
```

Available providers are:

* `phalcon`
* `propel`
* `eloquent`
* `cake`
* `yii`
* `doctrine`
* `activerecord`
* `dms`
* `nextrasorm`

Available tests are:

* `create`
* `read`

To run benchmark multiple times use:

```bash
php run <provider> <test> <times>
```

Some ORMs rely (depends) on models metadata caching. Thus, to avoid [controversy](https://github.com/sergeyklay/php-orm-benchmark/issues/4) there is an ability to create and run test with metadata caching support. To use models metadata caching (if supports) you can use the 4th command line argument as follows:

```bash
php run <provider> <test> <times> 1
```

### Uninstall PHP ORM Benchmark

To destroy the application use the following command from the host system:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker volume rm phpormbenchmark_mysql

rm -rf <path_to_cloned_project>
```
